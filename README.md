# Basic Version Control Tasks

- ## Explain version control

Version Control is a system that helps a developer to keep track of all the changes that have been made to a source code over time and takes a snapshot of every modification for easy recall of specific versions later. Version Control also makes it possible for a team of developers to collaborate remotely while building a product, tracking all changes and who makes these changes.
